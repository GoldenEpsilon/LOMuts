(DONE) - Add visual effects to Steel Nerves
 - Add sounds to everything
 - Make Heavy Heart refund the mutation point
 - Make Garment Regenerator not work on rebel
 - Fix union coop bugs
 - Mutation that selects a random mutation and gives you a mutation token
 - You cannot have a full selection of mutations that do not count as taking a mutation
 - Effect: Deal 2 damage to yourself, reroll other mutations in this selection (this does not count as taking a mutation)
 - Offering: Lose your primary weapon, heal to full health, reroll this mutation (this does not count as taking a mutation)
 - Indecision: Choose a mutation randomly to take, gain 1 mutation token (this does not count as taking a mutation)

(DONE) - Effect: Gain 50 rads, take 1 damage (this does not count as taking a mutation)
 - Effect: Pick from 4 effects out of a set of 8 (give it theming)
 - Effect: Each level has a "safe zone" that lasts until you leave it, only you and your bullets can go through the wall of the safe zone
 - Mutation tokens randomly appear in mutation sets (SEEDED), 50% chance for one to appear on any given set.
	- Mutation tokens appear as an icon on one of the mutations, taking that mutation gives you the mutation token.
	- When you enter a crown vault or loop with more than one mutation token, you get to select (like mutations) options for how you spend your mutation tokens:
		- (0 TOKENS) LEAVE : FINISH SPENDING TOKENS AND LEAVE
		- (1 TOKEN) BUY ORDNANCE : GET A LARGE WEAPON CHEST (it spawns next level)
		- (1 TOKEN) BUY SUPPLIES : HEAL TO FULL, GAIN 250 RADS
		- (1 TOKEN) BUY AMMO : GAIN AMMO (+25% MAX AMMO FOR EACH TYPE)
		- (1 TOKEN) DISRESPECT : GAIN AN OUTCAST MUTATION
		- (1 TOKEN) EXPERIMENT : REROLL A MUTATION AT RANDOM (one of your mutations gets rerolled, you get to pick a mutation after leaving the shop)
		- (1 TOKEN) GAMBLE : GAMBLE A MUTATION TOKEN (50/50 chance of getting two tokens back)
		- (2 TOKENS) REROLL : REROLL A MUTATION OUT OF FOUR (you get to pick one of four of your mutations to reroll, you get to pick a mutation after leaving the shop)
		- (2 TOKENS) EXTRACT : LOSE 2 MUTATIONS, GAIN SOMEONE ELSE'S ULTRA MUTATION (pick a mutation out of four to lose twice, then Mimicry)
		- (2 TOKENS) EMPOWER : LOSE 1 MUTATION, POWER UP 1 MUTATION (Thick Head)
		- (2 TOKENS) REBEL : CHOOSE AN OUTCAST MUTATION
		- (3 TOKENS) EVOLVE : GAIN A MUTATION (you get to pick a mutation after leaving the shop)
		- (3 TOKENS) RESET : RESET TO LEVEL 1, LOSING MUTATIONS
		- (3 TOKENS) BACKTRACK : HEAD BACK TO 1-1 (same loop)
		- (4 TOKENS) REVOLT: GAIN ONE OUTCAST MUTATION OUT OF ALL OUTCAST MUTATIONS
		- (4 TOKENS) BRIBE : HEAD TO YV'S CRIB (after leaving the shop you go to YV's Crib)
		- (4 TOKENS) WARP : INSTANTLY LOOP (go to 1-1 with +1 loop)
		- (5 TOKENS) INFUSE : GAIN SOMEONE ELSE'S ULTRA MUTATION (Mimicry)
		- (6 TOKENS) REDEEM: CHOOSE ONE OUTCAST MUTATION, IT IS NOW A NORMAL MUTATION (previous redeemed outcast mutations lose status)
		- (6 TOKENS) CAST DOWN: CHOOSE ONE NORMAL MUTATION, IT IS NOW AN OUTCAST MUTATION (previous cast down mutations return status)
		- (6 TOKENS) ASCEND : GAIN ANOTHER ULTRA (only shows up if you are already at level ultra)
		- (6 TOKENS) DESTABILIZE : REROLL ALL MUTATIONS
	- When heading to the shop, you get LEAVE, a 1 token option, a 2-3 token option, and a 4+ token option, selected randomly.

 - For the original Unstable DNA and Mimicry effects:
    - There is an Evolution Shrine in the vaults
	- you can trade in mutation tokens for rerolls (it shows what it rerolls into)
	- If you break it, it curses you, the curse starts affecting you the level after you reach ultra
	    - instead of "Level Up" or anything, it says "SHRINE DESECRATED#CHOOSE YOUR CURSE"
	- When the curse affects you, you choose between Unstable DNA, Mimicry, and two other effects
		- Options:
		  - Discombobulation (reset to level 1, keeping all mutations.)
		  - Mimicry (choose another mutant's ultra mutation to take)
		  - Corruption (All your current mutations get doubled in power)
		  - Heresy (Lose all your current mutations. Choose replacement mutations from the outcast pool.)
	- The curse caused by breaking the death totem affects enemies in some way
	    - curse ideas:
		  - drastically increased health for all enemies?
		  - lowered pickup drop rate?
		  - lowered rads?
		  - bosses randomly spawning?
		  - chance for double bosses?
		  - increased amounts of IDPD?
		  - greater elite chance?
		  - more enemy variety? (when a bandit spawns, spawn a bunch of random enemies at that location)
		  - faster alarms
		  - enemies do more damage
