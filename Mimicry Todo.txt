Note if you're reading this to know what mimicry can and can't do:
The ones that say "already working" or "partially working" rely on unused player slots to function properly.
There is no guarantee that they won't break player 3/4's ultras and possibly passives if you take them in a large lobby.
(player 4 if you take one ultra with mimicry, player 3 if you take two. (thick skull))

already working for mimicry:
Confiscate
Ambidextrous
Get Loaded
Refined Taste
Anomaly
Meltdown
Distance

Partially working for mimicry:
Detachment (max HP isn't lost)
Back 2 Bizniz/Ima Gun God (brings you to mansion)
Regurgitate (you can't pick the chests up that are created in time)

Implemented for mimicry:
gun warrant
fortress
Ima Gun God
Personal Guard
Detachment fix
Stalker
monster style (always active)
plant's ultras create/destroy a tangleseed at your feet when you use your active
Riot spawns 2+2*loop allies on level start
brain capacity (automatic activation)
projectile style will activate per projectile for one second. Have fun, anyone who tries to use this one.
Intimacy gives you toxic gas that is on your team

todo for mimicry:
Super Blast armor gives everyone super blast armor
Back 2 Bizniz gives you random pop pops

might do for mimicry:
Super Portal Strike auto-strikes the enemy with the most health when it comes on screen once per level.
Determination throws your weapon when out of ammo with the recall
Damnation auto-procs when out of ammo

Probably won't do anything with for mimicry:
juggernaut gives all characters a shield on active usage, with the slowed movement speed
Harder to Kill gives everyone the 1 second per kill at 0 health, up to 3 seconds (counts down even when not headless)

yeah... probably not for mimicry unless I do all others:
modded ultras. I don't even want to look at them rn.
